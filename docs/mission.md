# Mission

brain_emulation exists to make computational neuroscience—especially spiking neural networks (SNNs)—approachable, interactive, and rigorous for learners and researchers.

We aim to:
- Lower the barrier to understanding core SNN concepts through interactive visualizations and guided lessons.
- Connect practice with theory using curated references and concise explanations.
- Encourage transparent, open, and ethical collaboration across education and research communities.

Scope
- Education-first: prioritize clarity, reproducibility, and explainability.
- Research-friendly: provide room for experimentation and extensions.
- Honest framing: "brain emulation" here refers to long-term, exploratory concepts—not a claim of biological equivalence today.

Non-goals
- Claims of human-level or whole-brain emulation.
- Misleading levels of biological fidelity.
- Capturing sensitive personal data or enabling harmful applications.
