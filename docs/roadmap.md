# Roadmap (proposed)

This is a living document. Timelines and scope may change as the project evolves.

Now
- Establish documentation (mission, goals, roadmap, lessons, guidelines).
- Define lesson structure and contribution workflow.
- Create a minimal interactive demonstration and one starter lesson.

Next
- Expand lesson catalog (beginner â†’ intermediate).
- Add testing and basic CI for docs/examples where applicable.
- Improve accessibility and onboarding (clearer instructions, examples).

Later
- Advanced lessons (e.g., learning rules, network motifs, analysis workflows).
- Performance, larger experiments, and export/import utilities.
- Community-driven features based on feedback and use cases.

How to propose changes
- Open an issue describing the change with motivation and alternatives.
- If aligned, open a PR with a focused diff and updated docs where relevant.
