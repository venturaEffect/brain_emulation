# Goals and Audience

Audience
- Learners and students entering computational neuroscience.
- Educators seeking interactive demonstrations.
- Researchers and engineers prototyping ideas with simple, explainable models.
- Hobbyists curious about SNNs and network dynamics.

Goals
- Learning outcomes: build intuition for spiking activity, connectivity, and emergent behavior.
- Progressive lessons: beginner to advanced, with minimal prerequisites.
- Reproducibility: simple, documented examples that are easy to run.
- Extensibility: a structure where new lessons and modules can be added without friction.
- Community: contributions that improve clarity, correctness, and usefulness.

Design principles
- Clarity over completeness.
- Small, composable examples.
- Document as you go; keep tutorials close to runnable code.
- Be explicit about assumptions and limitations.
