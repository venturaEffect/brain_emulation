# brain_emulation

An open, educational, and research-focused project for learning spiking neural networks (SNNs) through interactive lessons and visualization‚Äîprogressing toward abstract brain emulation concepts and long-term exploration of digital brain emulation.

- Audience: researchers, neuroengineers, cognitive scientists, students, and hobbyists
- Focus: educational clarity, scientific plausibility, robustness, and open collaboration
- Vision: a progressive lesson system from beginner to advanced that stays up to date with SNN and neuroscience research
- Tech stack: Python (Brian2) + JavaScript (Three.js) with WebSockets

## Features (current and planned)
- Visual display of an SNN with panels showing key details
- Simple parameters to interact with spiking behavior
- Lesson dropdown with multiple starter lessons
- Planned:
  - Color-coded clusters
  - Adjustable neuron counts per cluster
  - Per-neuron info (weights, cluster membership, IDs)
  - Add/remove clusters and increase connectivity complexity

## Quickstart
- Install deps: `pip install brian2 websockets`
- Start SNN server: `python server.py`  (WebSocket at ws://localhost:8766)
- Serve UI: `python -m http.server 8000`
- Open: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
