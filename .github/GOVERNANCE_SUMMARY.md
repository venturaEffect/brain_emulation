# Repository Governance Implementation Summary

This document summarizes how the implemented changes address the requirements in the problem statement.

## Problem Statement Requirements

> "The repository is public from brain_emulation and anyone can fork it and write issues but we should include a discussion side on the project and also avoid of other users create changes on the main branch of the repository."

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. 🗣️ Discussion Side on the Project

**What was implemented:**
- **GitHub Discussions templates** in `.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/` for:
  - Research discussions (neuroscience papers, SNN concepts)
  - Implementation help (getting unstuck with code)
  - Idea brainstorming (new features and concepts)
- **Issue template configuration** that guides users to discussions
- **Documentation updates** promoting discussions in README and contributing guides
- **Clear separation** between formal issues and community discussions

**How to enable:**
- Repository admin needs to enable GitHub Discussions in Settings > Features
- Templates will automatically be available once enabled
- Documentation already promotes discussions as the primary way to engage

### 2. 🛡️ Prevent Direct Changes to Main Branch

**What was implemented:**
- **Pull Request template** that reminds contributors about branch protection
- **GitHub Actions workflow** that automatically comments on PRs explaining branch protection
- **Contributing guidelines** that clearly explain the fork/branch/PR workflow
- **Documentation** explaining why this protects the repository quality
- **Admin setup guide** with exact steps to configure branch protection

**How to enable:**
- Repository admin needs to set up branch protection rules (detailed instructions in `.github/ADMIN_SETUP.md`)
- Workflow will automatically inform contributors about the rules
- Documentation guides contributors to use proper workflow
