    <h1>Lesson 4: Pattern Recognition</h1>

    <p>
      Spiking Neural Networks excel at recognizing patterns in temporal data due
      to their inherent time dynamics. Unlike traditional neural networks, SNNs
      can process information as it arrives in real-time, making them ideal for
      time-series analysis and event-driven processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Temporal Coding</h2>

    <h3>Spike Timing</h3>
    <p>
      Information is encoded not just in which neurons fire, but when they fire.
      The precise timing of spikes carries meaning, allowing for much richer
      information representation than simple rate-based coding.
    </p>

    <h3>Temporal Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      Sequences of spikes that represent specific inputs or states. In our
      simulation, you can observe these as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Synchronous Bursts:</strong> Multiple neurons firing together
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sequential Activation:</strong> Spikes propagating through
        neural chains
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oscillatory Patterns:</strong> Rhythmic firing that repeats over
        time
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recognition Mechanisms</h2>

    <h3>Receptive Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Regions of the input space that activate specific neurons. Different
      neurons respond to different patterns, creating a distributed
      representation of information.
    </p>

    <h3>Winner-Take-All Competition</h3>
    <p>
      When multiple neurons compete to represent a pattern, the most strongly
      activated neuron "wins" and suppresses others. This creates clear,
      distinct responses to different inputs.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
    <p>
      Networks learn to detect specific features or patterns through experience.
      Neurons become selective for particular combinations of inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>Network Dynamics in Pattern Recognition</h2>

    <h3>Cluster Behavior</h3>
    <p>
      In our visualization, the four colored clusters represent different
      pattern detectors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blue Cluster:</strong> Responds to one type of pattern</li>
      <li><strong>Pink Cluster:</strong> Specialized for different features</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Yellow Cluster:</strong> Detects unique temporal sequences
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Orange Cluster:</strong> Integrates information from other
        clusters
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Flow</h3>
    <p>Watch how information propagates through the network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Input signals trigger specific clusters</li>
      <li>Active clusters influence connected regions</li>
      <li>Competition between clusters determines the final output</li>
      <li>Feedback connections refine the recognition process</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interactive Exploration</h2>

    <p>Experiment with pattern recognition by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Injecting Spikes:</strong> See how different starting points
        create different patterns
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monitoring Voltage Traces:</strong> Click neurons to see their
        response patterns
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjusting Parameters:</strong> Change network properties to
        affect recognition
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3D Navigation:</strong> Fly through the network to see pattern
        propagation from different angles
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications</h2>

    <p>SNN pattern recognition is used in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Real-time object detection and
        tracking
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speech Processing:</strong> Temporal pattern recognition in
        audio signals
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensor Networks:</strong> Event-driven processing of sensor data
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Robotics:</strong> Real-time decision making and motor control
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brain-Computer Interfaces:</strong> Decoding neural signals for
        prosthetic control
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The efficiency and biological realism of SNNs make them particularly
      valuable for applications requiring low power consumption and real-time
      processing.
