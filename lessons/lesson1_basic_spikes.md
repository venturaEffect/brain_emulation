# Lesson 1: Understanding Basic Spike Dynamics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how neurons integrate input over time
- Observe the relationship between input current and firing rate
- Visualize membrane potential dynamics and threshold crossing

## Theory

### The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model
A spiking neuron accumulates voltage over time according to:
