Where:
- `v` = membrane potential (voltage)
- `I` = input current (what you control)
- `τ` = membrane time constant (8ms in our simulation)

### Key Concepts
1. **Integration**: The neuron sums up all inputs over time
2. **Leak**: Without input, voltage decays back to 0 with time constant τ
3. **Threshold**: When voltage reaches 1.0, the neuron fires a spike
4. **Reset**: After spiking, voltage immediately returns to 0

## Interactive Experiments

### Experiment 1.1: Single Neuron Dynamics
1. **Select a neuron** by clicking on any blue sphere
2. **Watch the voltage trace** in the right panel:
   - Violet line shows voltage over time
   - Blue dashed line shows threshold (1.0V)
   - Numbers show current voltage value

3. **Observe the pattern**:
   - Voltage rises when neuron receives input
   - Voltage decays when no input arrives
   - Sharp drop to 0 when threshold is crossed

### Experiment 1.2: Input Current Control
Use the **Input Current** slider to control external stimulation:

**Low Input (0.0 - 0.2)**:
- Set slider to 0.1
- Observe: Slow voltage rise, rare spikes
- Why? Insufficient current to reach threshold quickly

**Medium Input (0.3 - 0.7)**:
- Set slider to 0.5
- Observe: Regular, predictable spikes
- Why? Balanced input creates steady firing

**High Input (0.8 - 2.0)**:
- Set slider to 1.2
- Observe: Rapid, frequent spikes
- Why? Strong input reaches threshold quickly

### Experiment 1.3: Time Constant Effects
The time constant (τ = 8ms) determines how fast the neuron responds:
- **Fast integration**: Voltage changes quickly with input
- **Slow leak**: Voltage doesn't decay too rapidly
- **Balanced dynamics**: Allows for realistic neural behavior

## Key Observations to Make

1. **What happens when input = 0?**
   - Voltage should decay exponentially toward 0
   - No spikes should occur

2. **What's the minimum input for spiking?**
   - Try values around 0.2-0.3
   - Find the threshold current for regular firing

3. **How does firing rate change with input?**
   - Higher input → Higher firing rate
   - Relationship is roughly linear for moderate inputs

## Questions to Explore

1. Why doesn't the neuron fire immediately when input > 1.0?
2. What would happen if the time constant was much larger?
3. How would random input (noise) affect the firing pattern?

## Mathematical Insight

The voltage equation has an analytical solution:

dv/dt = (-v + I) / τ

## Mathematical Insight

The voltage equation has an analytical solution:

v(t) = I(1 - e^(-t/τ)) + v₀e^(-t/τ)


For constant input I and initial voltage v₀:
- **Steady state**: v∞ = I (when t >> τ)
- **Time to threshold**: Depends on I and τ

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Find the Threshold Current
1. Start with Input Current = 0
2. Slowly increase until you see regular spikes
3. Record the minimum current needed
4. **Question**: Why isn't this exactly 1.0?

### Exercise 2: Measure Firing Rate
1. Set Input Current = 0.8
2. Count spikes for 10 seconds
3. Calculate firing rate (spikes/second)
4. Repeat for different input values
5. **Plot**: Input current vs firing rate

### Exercise 3: Voltage Dynamics
1. Set Input Current = 0.5
2. Watch several spike cycles
3. Measure time between spikes
4. **Question**: Is this time constant? Why/why not?
