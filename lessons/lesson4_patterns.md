# Lesson 4: Pattern Recognition and Memory

## Learning Objectives
- Explore how spiking networks can detect and learn patterns
- Understand the basis of neural memory
- Observe pattern completion and recall

## Theory

### Neural Memory
Memory in neural networks involves:
- **Encoding**: Patterns strengthen specific connections
- **Storage**: Connection patterns persist over time
- **Recall**: Partial inputs trigger full patterns

### Associative Memory
Networks can associate different patterns:
- **Auto-associative**: Complete partial patterns
- **Hetero-associative**: Link different patterns
- **Content-addressable**: Retrieve by partial content

### Hebbian Learning
"Neurons that fire together, wire together":
- Simultaneous activity strengthens connections
- Creates memory traces in the network
- Basis for pattern learning

## Interactive Experiments

### Experiment 4.1: Teaching Patterns
1. **Set Learning Rate** to 0.1 (moderate plasticity)
2. **Click "Inject Pattern"** multiple times
   - This teaches the network a specific pattern
   - Pattern: neurons [0, 5, 10, 15, 20] become active
   - Watch how these neurons light up together

3. **Observe learning effects**:
   - Repeated patterns strengthen connections
   - Network becomes biased toward learned pattern
   - Activity becomes more structured

### Experiment 4.2: Testing Memory
1. **After teaching patterns**, click "Test Memory"
2. **Partial pattern injection**: Only neurons [0, 5] are stimulated
3. **Watch the response**:
   - Does the network complete the pattern?
   - Do neurons [10, 15, 20] also activate?
   - How quickly does completion occur?

### Experiment 4.3: Pattern Competition
1. **Teach multiple different patterns**:
   - Pattern A: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]
   - Pattern B: [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
2. **Test with ambiguous inputs**
3. **Observe**:
   - Do patterns interfere with each other?
   - Which pattern dominates?
   - How does Pattern Strength affect competition?

### Experiment 4.4: Noise Robustness
1. **Teach a clear pattern**
2. **Add noise** by increasing Input Current
3. **Test pattern recall** under noisy conditions
4. **Question**: How much noise can memory tolerate?

## Key Concepts

### Attractor Dynamics
- Learned patterns become "attractors"
- Network state flows toward memorized patterns
- Basin of attraction determines recall region

### Capacity Limits
- Networks can only store limited patterns
- Too many patterns cause interference
- Trade-off between capacity and quality

### Generalization
- Networks can respond to similar patterns
- Allows recognition of variations
- Basis for flexible memory

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Memory Formation
1. Start with fresh network (Reset)
2. Inject same pattern 10 times
3. Monitor how network response changes
4. **Question**: How many repetitions are needed?

### Exercise 2: Pattern Completion
1. Teach a 5-neuron pattern
2. Test with 1, 2, 3, 4 neurons as cues
3. **Question**: What's the minimum cue needed?

### Exercise 3: Interference Effects
1. Teach Pattern A repeatedly
2. Then teach conflicting Pattern B
3. Test recall of Pattern A
4. **Question**: Does new learning erase old memories?

### Exercise 4: Storage Capacity
1. Try to teach many different patterns
2. Test recall quality for each
3. **Question**: How many patterns can be stored?

## Real-World Applications

### Biological Memory
- Hippocampus: Pattern separation and completion
- Cortex: Distributed memory storage
- Synaptic plasticity: Molecular basis of memory

### Artificial Intelligence
- Hopfield networks: Classic associative memory

- Spike-based pattern recognition
- Energy-efficient memory systems

### Medical Applications
- Understanding memory disorders
- Alzheimer's: Disrupted pattern completion
- PTSD: Overactive memory recall

## Advanced Topics

### Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
- Precise timing matters for learning
- Pre-before-post strengthens connections
- Post-before-pre weakens connections

### Oscillations and Binding
- Gamma rhythms bind features together
- Theta rhythms organize memory sequences
- Phase relationships encode information

### Metaplasticity
- Plasticity of plasticity itself
- Learning how to learn
- Homeostatic regulation of memory

## Mathematical Models

### Hopfield Network
Energy function: E = -½ ∑ᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ sᵢ sⱼ
- Stored patterns are energy minima
- Dynamics flow downhill to attractors

### BCM Rule
Weight change: Δw = ηφ(post)[pre - θ(post)]
- Bidirectional plasticity
- Sliding threshold prevents saturation

## Programming Challenge

Can you modify the simulation to:
1. Store multiple patterns
2. Test pattern completion
3. Measure memory capacity
4. Implement forgetting

## Troubleshooting

**Patterns not forming?**
- Increase Learning Rate
- Ensure sufficient repetitions
- Check pattern distinctiveness

**Memory interference?**
- Reduce number of stored patterns
- Increase pattern separation
- Use orthogonal patterns

**Recall failures?**
- Strengthen synaptic weights
- Reduce noise levels
- Use larger cue patterns
