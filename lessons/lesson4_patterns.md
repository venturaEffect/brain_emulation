# Lesson 4: Pattern Recognition and Memory

## Learning Objectives
- Explore how spiking networks can detect and learn patterns
- Understand the basis of neural memory
- Observe pattern completion and recall

## Theory

### Neural Memory
Memory in neural networks involves:
- **Encoding**: Patterns strengthen specific connections
- **Storage**: Connection patterns persist over time
- **Recall**: Partial inputs trigger full patterns

### Pattern Completion
- Networks can complete partial or noisy patterns
- Based on learned associations
- Demonstrates content-addressable memory

## Interactive Experiments

### Experiment 4.1: Teaching Patterns
1. **Set Learning Rate** to 0.1 (moderate plasticity)
2. **Click "Inject Pattern"** multiple times
   - This teaches the network a specific pattern
   - Watch how certain neurons become more active

3. **Observe learning**:
   - Repeated patterns strengthen connections
   - Network becomes biased toward learned pattern

### Experiment 4.2: Testing Memory
1. **After teaching patterns**, click "Test Memory"
2. **Watch the response**:
   - Does the network complete the pattern?
   - How quickly does it respond?
   - Is the response stable?

### Experiment 4.3: Memory Interference
1. **Teach multiple different patterns**
2. **Test each pattern**:
   - Do patterns interfere with each other?
   - Which pattern is strongest?
   - How does Pattern Strength affect learning?

## Applications

### Biological Memory
- Similar mechanisms in real brains
- Basis for learning and recall
- Explains memory disorders

### Artificial Intelligence
- Hopfield networks use similar principles
- Modern AI uses related concepts
- Inspiration for neuromorphic computing
