    <h1>Lesson 1: Basic Spike Dynamics</h1>

    <p>
      Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use discrete spikes to communicate
      information, unlike traditional neural networks that use continuous
      values. This fundamental difference makes SNNs more biologically realistic
      and energy-efficient.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <h3>Membrane Potential</h3>
    <p>
      The voltage inside a neuron that accumulates over time. In our simulation,
      this is represented by the <code>voltage</code> property of each neuron.
      As the neuron receives inputs from connected neurons, its membrane
      potential increases.
    </p>

    <h3>Threshold</h3>
    <p>
      When the membrane potential reaches this critical level (typically 1.0 in
      our simulation), the neuron fires a spike. This is the fundamental
      mechanism that determines when information is transmitted.
    </p>

    <h3>Spike Generation</h3>
    <p>
      A brief electrical pulse sent to all connected neurons when the threshold
      is reached. In our visualization, you can see this as the bright glow
      effect around firing neurons.
    </p>

    <h3>Reset Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      After firing, the membrane potential returns to 0, preparing the neuron
      for the next accumulation cycle. This prevents continuous firing and
      creates the discrete nature of spikes.
    </p>

    <h2>Interactive Exploration</h2>

    <p>
      Try adjusting the following parameters to see how they affect spike
      dynamics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Network Size:</strong> More neurons create more complex spike
        patterns
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connection Probability:</strong> Higher values create more
        interconnected networks
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firing Rate:</strong> Controls how often neurons spontaneously
        fire
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spike Threshold:</strong> Lower values make neurons fire more
        easily
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Watch how spikes propagate through the network and create cascading
      patterns of activity!
