# Lesson 6: Inhibition and Competition

## Core Concepts

- Excitatory vs inhibitory neurons
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- E/I balance principles
- Lateral inhibition mechanisms

## Learning Objectives

- Understand neural competition and selection
- Explore inhibitory mechanisms in networks
- Learn about attention and decision-making
- Recognize E/I balance importance

## Interactive Elements

- E/I balance adjustment
- Competitive dynamics visualization
- Threshold manipulation
- Selection mechanism demonstration

## Real-world Connection

- Attention mechanisms in the brain
- Decision-making processes
- Motor control and selection
- Sensory processing and filtering

## Key Insights

- Inhibition is as important as excitation for neural computation
- Competition creates selection and decision-making capabilities
- E/I balance must be carefully tuned for stable operation
- Many brain disorders involve disrupted competitive mechanisms
