# Lesson 5: Network Topology and Clustering

## Core Concepts

- Small-world networks and modularity
- Clustering coefficient and path length
- Hub nodes and network efficiency
- Brain-like network organization

## Learning Objectives

- Understand brain-like network organization principles
- Recognize how network structure affects function
- Explore clustering dynamics in neural networks
- Connect network topology to biological brain regions

## Interactive Elements

- Cluster formation visualization
- Rewiring experiments
- Hub node identification
- Path length analysis

## Real-world Connection

- Brain regions as functional networks
- Network disorders (autism, schizophrenia)
- Social network analogies
- Internet and transportation networks

## Key Insights

- Small-world topology optimizes both local processing and global communication
- Clustering enables specialized processing while maintaining integration
- Hub nodes are critical for network function but vulnerable to damage
- Network structure is as important as individual node properties
