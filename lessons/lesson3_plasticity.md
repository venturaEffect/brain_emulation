# Lesson 3: Network Plasticity and Learning

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how neural networks adapt and learn
- Explore activity-dependent synaptic changes
- Observe how patterns emerge from network dynamics

## Theory

### What is Neural Plasticity?
Plasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize and adapt:
- **Synaptic plasticity**: Connection strengths change based on activity
- **Structural plasticity**: New connections form, old ones disappear
- **Homeostasis**: Networks maintain stable activity levels

## Interactive Experiments

### Experiment 3.1: Critical Dynamics
Networks can exist in different regimes:

1. **Subcritical** (low weights/connectivity):
   - Activity dies out quickly
   - Poor signal transmission

2. **Critical** (balanced parameters):
   - Activity propagates but doesn't explode
   - Optimal for computation
   - Maximum information capacity

3. **Supercritical** (high weights/connectivity):
   - Explosive, synchronized activity
   - Poor information processing

**Try This**: Gradually increase Connection Density from 0.02 to 0.2
- Watch for the transition point where behavior changes dramatically
- This is a **phase transition** in network dynamics

### Experiment 3.2: Self-Organization
1. **Start with random network** (Reset Network)
2. **Set moderate parameters**:
   - Input Current: 0.4
   - Synaptic Weight: 0.2
   - Connection Density: 0.1

3. **Observe long-term behavior**:
   - Initially: Random, scattered activity
   - After time: Patterns begin to emerge
   - Eventually: Stable activity clusters

## Real-World Applications
- **Brain development**: Networks self-organize during growth
- **Learning**: Synaptic changes encode memories and skills
- **Recovery**: Networks reorganize after injury
- **AI**: Artificial networks use similar principles

## Next Steps
